# ðŸ‘¾DAEBUG: Remote REPL

A file-based REPL for running JavaScript code in live pages. The server watches per-instance Markdown files under `daebug/` and sends code to connected pages for execution.

## How it works

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Open a page at `http://localhost:8302/` â€” the client injects and polls the server
3. Create a file under `daebug/` with a fenced code block and the canonical footer
4. The server runs the code and writes the result back into the same file

## File structure

- `daebug.md` â€” registry of connected pages (server-managed)
- `daebug/` â€” per-instance chat logs; agents create these files
- `js/` â€” Node.js server modules

The server does NOT create `daebug/` or per-instance files. Agents (editors, CLI) must create them.
