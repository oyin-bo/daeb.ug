# Directness

Always give direct answers to questions, without including any extra commentary or preamble.

# Code comments

Comments should explain complex or non-obvious code quirks and intent, NOT mirror code actions.

Comments always relate to the current code state, NEVER to changes made NOR to previous state.

# Directness

Always give direct answers to questions. DO NOT embellish or recommend anything unless requested.

Do not announce writing TODOs.
