To begin a new debugging session:

npm start
${'```'}

## Active Sessions

${pageList}
`}

## How to Use

**Key Features:**
- **Live execution**: Code runs in actual browser/worker contexts, not simulated
- **Async/await support**: Promises resolve naturally, no special handling needed
- **Multi-realm**: Main pages and their web workers are tracked separately
- **File-based protocol**: No IDE plugins required, just edit Markdown files

**Workflow:**
1. Open any session file from the list above
2. Scroll to bottom and add code in a JS fenced block (after the prompt line)
3. Save the file
4. Results appear automatically within 1-2 seconds

## Restart

To exit write \`%%SHUTDOWN%%\` **in this file on a separate line,** then run \`npm start\` again.
